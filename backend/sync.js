/**
 * Implementation of the data synchronisation protocol that brings a local and a remote document
 * into the same state. This is typically used when two nodes have been disconnected for some time,
 * and need to exchange any changes that happened while they were disconnected. The two nodes that
 * are syncing could be client and server, or server and client, or two peers with symmetric roles.
 *
 * The protocol is based on this paper: Martin Kleppmann and Heidi Howard. Byzantine Eventual
 * Consistency and the Fundamental Limits of Peer-to-Peer Databases. https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00472
 *
 * The protocol assumes that every time a node successfully syncs with another node, it remembers
 * the current heads (as returned by `Backend.getHeads()`) after the last sync with that node. The
 * next time we try to sync with the same node, we start from the assumption that the other node's
 * document version is no older than the outcome of the last sync, so we only need to exchange any
 * changes that are more recent than the last sync. This assumption may not be true if the other
 * node did not correctly persist its state (perhaps it crashed before writing the result of the
 * last sync to disk), and we fall back to sending the entire document in this case.
