# Changelog

Automerge adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for assigning
version numbers. However, any feature that is not documented or labelled as "experimental" may
change without warning in a minor release.

All notable changes to Automerge will be documented in this file, which
is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## Performance branch (working towards Automerge 1.0 release candidate)

- **Changed**: The data format for storing/transmitting changes (as returned by
  `Automerge.getChanges()`) and documents (as returned by `Automerge.save()`) have changed.
  They now use a binary encoding that is much more compact than the old JSON format. This is a
  breaking change, but we will provide an upgrade tool to migrate any existing Automerge docs
  to the new format.
- **Changed**: `Automerge.applyChanges()` now returns a two-element array, where the first
  element is the updated document, and the second element is a patch describing the changes that
  have been made (including any conflicts that have arisen). This simplifies applications that
  need to update some other state, such as a user interface, to reflect changes in a document.
- **Changed**: `Automerge.Connection`, `Automerge.DocSet`, and `Automerge.WatchableDoc` have been
  removed, and replaced with a new Automerge sync protocol that is implemented by the functions
  `Automerge.generateSyncMessage()` and `Automerge.receiveSyncMessage()`.
- **Changed**: The frontend/backend protocol (change requests generated by `Frontend.change()`
  and patches returned by `Backend.applyChanges()`) has changed. The new format will be
  documented separately.
- **Removed**: The undo/redo feature is removed for now. The original implementation was a bit of
  a hack, and we decided not to support the hack for 1.0. Instead, we will bring back a
  better-designed version of this feature in the future.
- **Changed**: Actor IDs are now required to consist only of lowercase hexadecimal digits
  (UUIDs can still be used, but the hyphens need to be removed).
- **Changed**: `Automerge.getConflicts()` now returns *all* conflicting values, including the
  value chosen as default resolution.
- **Changed**: `Automerge.Text.insertAt` now takes two arguments, the index and the characters to
  insert. The characters can be given either as a string (which will be split into characters),
  or as an array that is already split into individual characters.
- **Changed**: Multiple references to the same object in an Automerge document are no longer
  allowed. In other words, the document is now required to be a tree, not a DAG.
- **Changed**: We no longer assume that the backend state is immutable, giving us greater freedom
  to implement the backend in a way that maximises performance. (Frontend state and Automerge
  documents remain immutable as before.) This restricts certain usage patterns: for example, if
  you update a document, you cannot then take a reference to the document state before that
  update and update or query it. If you want to be able to continue referencing an old document
  state, you can copy it using `Automerge.clone()`.
- **Removed**: `Automerge.diff` and `Backend.merge`, because they depended on the assumption of
  an immutable backend. We hope to bring back a better implementation of `Automerge.diff` in the
  future.
- **Changed**: Dependencies between changes are now expressed by referencing the hashes of
  dependencies, rather than their actorId and sequence number. APIs have changed accordingly:
  `Backend.getMissingDeps` now returns a list of hashes rather than a vector clock; the second
  argument of `Backend.getChanges()` is now also a list of hashes. This change also affects
  network sync protocols, e.g. based on `Automerge.Connection`, which need to now exchange
  hashes rather than vector clocks.
- **Removed**: `Automerge.getMissingDeps()`; use `Backend.getMissingDeps()` instead.
- **Removed**: `Backend.getMissingChanges()`; use `Backend.getChanges()` instead.
- **Removed**: `Backend.getChangesForActor()` since it does not fit with a hash chaining approach.
- **Added**: `Frontend.getLastLocalChange()` returns the binary encoding of the last change made
  by the local actor, and `Backend.getHeads()` returns the latest change hashes in the current
  document state.
- **Changed**: `Backend.applyLocalChange()` now returns an array of three values: the updated
  backend state, the patch to apply to the frontend, and the binary encoding of the change.
- **Added** [#308]: Experimental `Automerge.Observable` API allows an application to receive
a callback whenever a document (or some object within a document) changes ([@ept])

## [Unreleased]

## [0.14.0] — 2020-03-25

## [0.10.1] — 2019-05-17

  a casualty of the refactoring in [#118] ([@ept])

## [0.8.0] — 2018-08-02
